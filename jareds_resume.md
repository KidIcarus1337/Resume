## Intro

I am a software developer who has taught himself over the years with the aid of several online courses and occasional help of an experienced mentor. Though originally I had specialized in the front-end side of things, I have since gradually branched out to many other facets of development and design, and more recently I have had exposure to working in a professional environment.
